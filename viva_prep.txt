1. Introduction to System Software

# System Software 

- acts as an interface between hardware and user applications
- Goals:
    -- convenience - cmd, shell
    -- resource management - cpu should not be idle
    -- optimization - hardware
    -- security - read write permissions


# System Program 

- tools that help in managing and controlling computer operations

1. Assembler
- convert assembly language code into machine code

2. macro Processor
- expand macros into actual code
- save repetitive effort

3. Loader 
- loads machine code into memory
- resolves addresses 
- give actual space in memory

4. Linker
- combines multiple files into a single executable file 
- link library files

5. Compiler
- translates high level language to machine code
- output as machine code
- is smart

6. Interpreter
- line by line 
- slower but easy for debugging

7. Device drivers
- os to communicate with hardware devices
- printer, graphic card

8. Operating System
- collection of Program to execute instructions
- process scheduling, file management

9. Editors

10. Debuggers
- break points
- watch variables

# Difference in System software and application software

- controls basic system operations
- perform user specific tasks

- platform to run application software
- helps users to perform tasks

- os, compilers
- ms, word, executable

- written in low level language 
- high level languages

- comes pre installed
- installed on user needs

- is on everytime
- is on when user needs











2. Assemblers

# Structure

label
mnemonic
operands
comments

# Types of Statements

1. imperative - ADD, SUB, mover
2. declaration statements - DC - storage and value, DS - storage only
3. assembler directives - Start, end, origin, equ, drop, using, LTORG, end

# Data Structures of Assembler

- MOT - Machine operation table - pre defined table 
- POT - pseudo operation table - pre defined table - assembler directives
- Symbol table 
- literal table 
- base table - yes no

# Forward reference problem

ADD R1, A 
-
-
A DC '1'

- call first declare later
- to solve this we use two pass assembler


# Two pass assembler

- Pass 1 - entry in symbol and literal table - analysis plase
- Pass 2 - refer pass 1 and then generate the object code - synthesis phase


whose intermediate code are not generated
- label 
- origin
- eqa 

whose object code is not generated
- ltorg 
- dl 

example code 
ADD BREG, 1 - (IS, 03) 02 (L,1)


# Single pass assembler

- for solving the forward reference
- we use TII table - table of incomplete instructions
- we store its address no and the symbol
- so that when we get that symbol declaration, we can go that address and give the value of that address











3. Macros and Macro Processor

# macro definition

MACRO
    INCR &arg
    A1, &arg
    A2, &arg
MEND

# macro call

INCR data1 


# Types of macro


1. Macro instruction argument
MACRO
&label  INCR &arg
        A1, &arg
        A2, &arg
MEND

2. Conditional Macro
- aif and ago

MACRO
&arg0 INCR &cnt, &arg1, &arg2
      &arg0 A1, &arg1
      AIF(&cnt EQ 1).FINI
      &arg0 A2, &arg2
FINI MEND

3. Macro call within macro

4. Macro definition within macro - nested macro 

# Data structures of macro Processor pass 1
- mdt - all definition 
- mnt - just the index of the mdt
- mdtc - pointers
- mntc - pointers
- ala - just the arguments

# Data structures of macro Processor pass 2
- mdtp
- mntp 
- ala 













4. Loaders and Linkers 

# Functions
- allocation - allocate space for Program
- linking - linking diff object codes
- relocation - adjust all address dependent locations
- loading - place machine instructions into memory


# Types of Loader

1. Compile/Assemble and go Loader - assembler is in the memory
2. General loader scheme - loader is there in memory

3. Absolute Loader - allocation, linking by programmer , relocation by assembler - loading by loader
    Text card - 
    Transfer card - 

4. Direct Linking Loader - 
- copy to memory + adjust addresses and external references
- absolute loader just copies with fixed addresses

5. Dynamic loader 
- loads the files on runtime

















5. Compilers: Analysis Phase 

# Context 

preprocessor (header files) - compiler - assembler (machine code) - linker - loader 


# Phases of compiler

- lexical analyzer - regular expression - type 3 grammar
- syntax analyzer - generates parse tree - type 2 grammar - cfg
- semantic analyzer - find mismatch, out of bound
- intermediate code generation 
- code optimization
- code generation

# Lexical Analyzer

- scans the HLL code and takes lexemes and produces tokens
- Tokens:
    identifier
    operator
    keyword
    punctuators
    constants
    literals
    special characters

- data structures - DFA, transition table, token buffer

# Syntax Analyzer

- parse tree 
- first and follow
- left recursion 
    A -> BA'
    A' -> aA' | E 
- left factoring

- Types of parsers

Steps:
- first and follow
- parse table
- stack implementation
- parse tree

    LL1 Parser
        - start from the input string and get $ on both sides

    Recursive descendent parser - Top down parser
        - we have to draw the parse tree, back track

    Bottom up parser (Shift reduce parser) - LR0
        - augment the grammar (.)

    operator precedence parser (bottom up)


















5. Compilers: Synthesis Phase 

# Intermediate codes

- postfix expression
    - exy?

- 3 - address code
    if and goto
    t2[t1] 

- syntax tree

# Basic Block

- leader 
    first statement
    target statement of else
    statement after any goto 


# Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

- no cycles and eliminate common sub expressions

# Code optimization

- peephole
eliminate redundant, unreachable, jumps, strength reduction, algebric simplification

- other
compile time evaluation
constant propagation - x = 10, y = x/5 directly y = 2
dead code elimination
common subexpression elimination
loop optimization
loop unrolling  - write statement twice
loop jamming
